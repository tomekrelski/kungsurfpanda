    <h1>The four seasons in Tarifa</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <p>
            Tarifa is more than just wind it's a place with soul. Every day here feels different, as each wind brings its
            own unique microclimate.
            Without even leaving town, you can feel like you're in a completely different place. It's a haven for active
            people kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, cycling, climbing, trekking all within reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tarifa is never the same the wind can surprise you with its direction, strength, or temperature. You can‚Äôt
            fully predict it, and that‚Äôs exactly what makes it magical.
    
            Even though it‚Äôs just a small corner of land that looks like the end of Europe, everything is within arm‚Äôs
            reach. It‚Äôs never too hot, never too cold, and in summer, the water can pleasantly cool you off after a sun filled day. There‚Äôs a constant flow of energy
            here not just from the wind people come and go like the seasons: surfers, nomads, creatives escaping city life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tarifa is also a transition point many travelers head on to Morocco from here, but they leave a piece of
            themselves behind.
            That‚Äôs why you can meet amazing people, have unexpected conversations,
            and feel like everything you need is already right here. Because Tarifa may be a small town, but it has a heart
            bigger than many big cities.

        <h2>üåû Summer (June August)</h2>
        <p>
            Summer in Tarifa means crowds, high temperatures, and long days. The beaches are buzzing with energy but they
            can get packed. Kite zones are enforced (15.06‚Äì15.09), so riding is more regulated with whistles and patrols.
            Restaurants and parking spots require patience, but the weather is nearly always great. The water is warm, and
            the vibe is unmistakably holiday like.
        </p>

                <h3>Wind</h3>
                <p>
                    In summer, thermals and Levante dominate. Winds are steady and consistent, but the spot‚Äôs popularity
                    means more people and zone restrictions. Ideal for freeride and learning.

                <h3>Waves</h3>
                <p>
                    Mostly flat perfect for freestyle. Swells are rare, but you might get a nice micro wave. For surfers,
                    it‚Äôs more of a longboard season or early morning glassy sessions.

                <h3>Wetsuits</h3>
                <p>
                    Water is around 20¬∞C. Shorties or light 2/2 mm wetsuits are enough. Cold sensitive folks might prefer
                    3/2 mm. The sun is strong, so don‚Äôt forget UV protection.

        <p>
            Autumn in Tarifa is a golden time still warm, but without the summer crowds. Beaches calm down, and the riding
            conditions often become ideal. The first bigger swells might appear, and Levante and Poniente fight for
            dominance. The sun still shines bright, and you can feel the balance between summer and winter in the air.

        <h2>‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter (December ‚Äì February)</h2>
        <p>
            Winter is the most unpredictable season, but also one of the most exciting. When Levante comes, it can be dry
            and warm giving the illusion of spring. Storms, strong waves, and nature‚Äôs raw spectacle are also possible.
            The water is almost empty, and the vibe is more local and rugged.

            wind comes back into play. It‚Äôs the perfect time for exploring ideal for biking, climbing, and kitesurfing.
