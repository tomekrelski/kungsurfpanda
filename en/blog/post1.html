            <h2>My Journey — And Yours</h2>
            <p>
                I started water sports when I was a teenager. My first love was windsurfing — feeling the pull of the
                sail and racing across the water. Later, I discovered kitesurfing, which I taught for nearly 20 years.
                It was a perfect mix of wind and control, a technical dance between you and nature. After that came
                surfing — more raw, more about feeling and less about gear. Now I just love playing with the waves,
                sometimes even without a board — bodysurfing reminds you that your body is enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this isn’t just a story about me. It’s about you. Maybe you’re curious about which sport could open
                the door for you. Here’s a breakdown of some options.
            </p>
        </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Types of Water Sports & What Makes Each One Unique 🌊</h2>
    
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Kitesurfing 🪁 + 🌊</h3>
            <p>
                A technical, dynamic sport that combines wind power and water navigation. You'll learn kite control,
                board balance, and aerial movements. Great for thrill-seekers and fast learners.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes it unique: Kitesurfing is a dance with the wind. You’re not just riding waves — you’re flying
                above them.
                It’s fast, exhilarating, and perfect for those who love gear, adrenaline, and the sensation of freedom in
                the air.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Surfing 🏄</h3>
            <p>
                More about flow and reading waves. You don't rely on equipment beyond a board. It’s meditative, yet
                physically intense. Surfing teaches patience and timing.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes it unique: Surfing connects you deeply to the rhythm of the ocean. It’s about feel, timing, and
                grace.
                No motors, no sails — just you and the perfect wave. It's as pure and soulful as it gets.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Wing Foil 🪂</h3>
            <p>
                A mix between surfing and kiting. You hold a wing and ride on a foil board. It’s futuristic, light,
                and almost like flying — a completely new sensation on water.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes it unique: Wing foiling is like gliding on air. The hydrofoil lifts you above the water while the
                handheld wing gives you power and freedom.
                It feels smooth, weightless, and incredibly fun for adventurers and early adopters.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Body Surfing 🌊</h3>
            <p>
                Minimalist and pure. No board, no kite — just you and the ocean. You learn to move with the wave and
                use your body as the vehicle. It's fun, playful, and accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes it unique: Body surfing is all about instinct. It’s the most natural way to ride waves — no
                equipment, just timing, positioning, and joy.
                It’s spontaneous, raw, and endlessly playful.

        <h2>Mix It Up — Why Combining Water Sports Is Awesome 🌤️</h2>
        <div class="info-card">
            <p>
                One of the best parts of getting into water sports is the flexibility they offer. Each day on the ocean is
                different — and having a few skills under your belt means you can always make the most of it:
            </p>
            <ul style="text-align:left; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                <li>💨 <strong>Windy day?</strong> Grab your kite or wing and fly across the water!</li>
                <li>🌊 <strong>Waves but no wind?</strong> Time to ride them with your surfboard or even just your body.
                </li>
                <li>🌪️ <strong>Messy conditions?</strong> That’s perfect for body surfing — no gear needed, just play and
                    connect with the sea.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <strong>Tarifa</strong> is one of the best places in the world to explore this variety. Known as the wind
                capital of Europe, it delivers a mix of conditions that keeps every day fresh. On light wind days with
                <em>Poniente</em>, kite foiling or wing foiling are your go-to — smooth, efficient, and perfect for
                maximizing every breeze. When the <em>Levante</em> kicks in strong, it's game on for big jumps, fast rides,
                and pure adrenaline with your kite or wing.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if things get stormy or chaotic, with choppy water and unpredictable gusts? That’s when the magic of
                body surfing comes in — no equipment needed, just you embracing the ocean’s raw power. Tarifa teaches you to
                adapt, flow, and find joy in every condition. It’s not just about mastering one sport — it’s about learning
                to read the sea and letting it guide your session.
