                    My inner journey started at 12, when I was doing Aikido, yoga, and probably asking deeper questions
                    than most adults.
                </p>
                <p id="fullTextPrana" style="display: none;">
                    I was lucky to learn from real-deal Himalayan masters who showed me the ropes of Pranayama, Yoga
                    Nidra, and other ways to sit still without falling asleep.
                    <br><br>
                    But the real game-changer came in 2018: a 10-day silent Vipassana retreat in Thailand. No phone, no talking, no eye
                    contact just me, my thoughts, up to 20 hours of meditation a day, and a bunch of mosquito bites. It totally rewired my
                    brain in the best way. I even did it again the next year (yes, on purpose).
                    <br><br>
                    Since then, meditation isn’t just something I do; it’s part of who I am. Every day, at least 10 minutes of sitting,
                    observing my breath. It’s like drilling a hole in rock slow, steady, but over time, the change is inevitable.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m also hooked on breathwork, ecstatic dance, and any practice that helps me feel more balanced, happier, still, and
                    open-minded. It’s all about feeling more human, grounded, and in tune with the present moment.
