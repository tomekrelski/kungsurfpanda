                    <p id="shortText">
                        My kitesurfing adventure began in 2004 on Lake Miedwie, Poland with zero instructors, a stack of sketchy VHS tapes, and
                        my dad shouting advice from the water as we tried to figure it out together.
                    </p>
                    <p id="fullText" style="display: none;">
                        In 2005, I fell head over heels for Tarifa during my first summer here spending all day at the beach, sunburned and
                        stoked, trying (and failing) to land new tricks. Basically, it was kiting 5â€“6 hours a day, wiping out gloriously, and
                        living the sandy, salty dream
                        <br><br>
                        From there, I traveled the world with my dad Canary Islands, Turkey, Egypt, and more. As a local
                        from Lake Miedwie, I was always ready to kite, no matter the forecast.
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward to 2011, I moved to Tarifa and worked as a manager in top kite schools. In 2015, I cofounded my own school with my sister and her partner. It was a wild business
                        adventure and a ton of teaching thatâ€™s when I knew this is my passion!
                        <br><br>
                        Now, I teach at Alex Pastor Kite Club, sharing all my hard earned kite wisdom with anyone ready to learn in everything
                        from Tarifaâ€™s gentle Poniente breeze to the wild, gusty Levante beast. Master the wind here, and you'll be ready for any
                        spot on the planet..
                        <br><br>
                        If you want an experienced instructor whoâ€™ll make your learning journey safe, smooth, and
                        fun youâ€™re in great hands!

            <h2>Kite Styles</h2>
            <p>With over 20 years of kitesurfing experience, I've explored various styles that offer unique thrills and
                challenges. Here are the three main kite styles I specialize in:</p>

            <div style="display: inline-flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; align-items: center;">
        
                <button class="btn btn-black" data-style="twin-tip" style="min-width: 280px;">
                    Twin Tip
                </button>
                <div class="style-info" id="twin-tip" hidden>
                    <p>Twin tip kitesurfing is versatile and dynamic. Itâ€™s perfect for freestyle tricks, big air jumps, and riding in
                        both directions without changing your stance. Early in my journey, I loved mastering freestyle moves, pushing
                        limits, and catching high-powered airtime with this style.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="btn btn-white" data-style="surf-kite" style="min-width: 280px;">
                    Surf Kite
                </button>
                <div class="style-info" id="surf-kite" hidden>
                    <p>Surf kiting uses the kite to harness wave power, combining the thrill of surfing with kite control. It
                        excels in choppy or windy conditions when traditional surfing gets tough, allowing you to ride waves
                        with fluidity and power.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="btn btn-black" data-style="kite-foil" style="min-width: 280px;">
                    Kite Foil
                </button>
                <div class="style-info" id="kite-foil" hidden>
                    <p>Kite foiling opened new horizons for me on light wind days. Using a foil board lifts you above the water,
                        enabling smooth, fast rides even below 10 knots. Itâ€™s a liberating style perfect for exploring calm
                        conditions solo or with friends.</p>
