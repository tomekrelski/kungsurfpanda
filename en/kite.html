                        My kitesurfing adventure began in 2004 on Lake Miedwie, Poland—with zero instructors, a stack of sketchy VHS tapes, and
                        my dad shouting advice from the water as we tried to figure it out together.
                    </p>
                    <p id="fullText" style="display: none;">
                        In 2005, I fell head over heels for Tarifa during my first summer here spending all day at the beach, sunburned and
                        stoked, trying (and failing) to land new tricks. Basically, it was kiting 5–6 hours a day, wiping out gloriously, and
                        living the sandy, salty dream
                        <br><br>
                        From there, I traveled the world with my dad Canary Islands, Turkey, Egypt, and more. As a local
                        from Lake Miedwie, I was always ready to kite, no matter the forecast.
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward to 2011, I moved to Tarifa and worked as a manager in top kite schools. In 2015, I co-founded my own school with my sister and her partner. It was a wild business
                        adventure and a ton of teaching—that’s when I knew this is my passion!
                        <br><br>
                        Now, I teach at Alex Pastor Kite Club, sharing all my hard-earned kite wisdom with anyone ready to learn in everything
                        from Tarifa’s gentle Poniente breeze to the wild, gusty Levante beast. Master the wind here, and you'll be ready for any
                        spot on the planet..
                        <br><br>
                        If you want an experienced instructor who’ll make your learning journey safe, smooth, and
                        fun—you’re in great hands!
