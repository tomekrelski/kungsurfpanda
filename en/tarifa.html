                    I first came to Tarifa in 2005. Something clicked immediately – like this place was whispering to me
                    through the wind.
                </p>
                <p id="fullTextTarifa" style="display: none;">
                    Tarifa is wild and raw. It's where the Mediterranean kisses the Atlantic and the wind never stops
                    dancing.
                    Back then, it was just a visit – a trip. But the connection was real.
                    <br><br>
                    I came back. Again and again. In 2011, I finally made the move. Since then, this has been home – my
                    base, my space, my soul spot.
                    I'm what I like to call a **Polarifeño** – part Polish, part Tarifeño. It's a made-up word, but it
                    fits.
                    <br><br>
                    I know the beaches, the backstreets, the hidden hiking trails, and where to get the best local fish
                    or that perfect sunset beer.
                    Tarifa isn’t just about the party or the surf – it’s about energy, wind, nature, people, silence and
                    sound.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you're just passing through or staying a while, I can help you tap into the real Tarifa –
                    not just the tourist version.
