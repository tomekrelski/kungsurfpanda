                    I first came to Tarifa in 2005. Something clicked immediately like this place was whispering to me
                    through the wind.
                </p>
                <p id="fullTextTarifa" style="display: none;">
                    Tarifa is wild and raw. It's where the Mediterranean kisses the Atlantic and the wind never stops
                    dancing.
                    Back then, it was just a visit a trip. But the connection was real.
                    <br><br>
                    I came back. Again and again. In 2011, I finally made the move. Since then, this has been home my
                    base, my space, my soul spot.
                    I'm what I like to call a **PolarifeÃ±o** part Polish, part TarifeÃ±o. It's a made-up word, but it
                    fits.
                    <br><br>
                    I know the beaches, the backstreets, the hidden hiking trails, and where to get the best local fish
                    or that perfect sunset beer.
                    Tarifa isnâ€™t just about the party or the surf itâ€™s about energy, wind, nature, people, silence and
                    sound.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you're just passing through or staying a while, I can help you tap into the real Tarifa
                    not just the tourist version.
