                    I rode my first wave in 2008 at Balneario, Tarifa and that was it. One perfect glide, and I was completely hooked. I
                    still remember the feeling: part magic, part panic, and 100% life-changing. From that day on, I wasn’t just riding
                    waves I was riding straight into a lifestyle of salty hair, sandy gear, and chasing stoke ever since.
                </p>
                <p id="surfFull" style="display: none;">
                    In 2009, I joined the Erasmus program in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria where I somehow managed to
                    surf
                    every single day for 10 months… and get paid for it. Legendary student exchange!
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks to seasonal jobs (and some creative budgeting), I chased waves around the world from
                    Morocco
                    and Portugal to Peru, Bali, and beyond. Every windless day in Tarifa became a surf mission.
                    <br><br>
                    I love riding all kinds of waves, on all kinds of boards short, long, soft, weird-shaped... if it
                    floats, I’ll surf it.
                    <br><br>
                    When the sea’s sleeping, I train on land with surfskate, slackline, balance boards, and mobility
                    drills because you can always be a bit smoother, faster, and funnier on a wave.
                    For me, surfing isn't just a sport it's a way of life (and an excuse to always be sandy and
                    salty).
