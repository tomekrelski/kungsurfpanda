                    I rode my first wave in 2008 at Balneario, Tarifa and that was it. One perfect glide, and I was completely hooked. I
                    still remember the feeling: part magic, part panic, and 100% life changing. From that day on, I wasnâ€™t just riding
                    waves I was riding straight into a lifestyle of salty hair, sandy gear, and chasing stoke ever since.
                </p>
                <p id="surfFull" style="display: none;">
                    In 2009, I joined the Erasmus program in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria where I somehow managed to
                    surf
                    every single day for 10 monthsâ€¦ and get paid for it. Legendary student exchange!
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks to seasonal jobs (and some creative budgeting), I chased waves around the world from
                    Morocco
                    and Portugal to Peru, Bali, and beyond. Every windless day in Tarifa became a surf mission.
                    <br><br>
                    I love riding all kinds of waves, on all kinds of boards short, long, soft, weird-shaped... if it
                    floats, Iâ€™ll surf it.
                    <br><br>
                    When the seaâ€™s sleeping, I train on land with surfskate, slackline, balance boards, and mobility
                    drills because you can always be a bit smoother, faster, and funnier on a wave.
                    For me, surfing isn't just a sport it's a way of life (and an excuse to always be sandy and
                    salty).

        <h2>Surf Styles</h2>
        <p>Over the years, surfing has become a huge part of my lifestyle. My personal quiver includes everything from a
            handplane for bodysurfing to a 9'4" longboard and thereâ€™s always room for more. Sometimes I even borrow my
            girlfriendâ€™s board! Each board brings something unique to the waves. Here are my favorite surf styles:</p>

            <button class="btn btn-black" data-style="short-board" style="min-width: 280px;">
                Short Board
            </button>
            <div class="style-info" id="short-board" hidden>
                <p>I started surfing with a board that was too small, but growing up riding powerful waves in the Canary
                    Islands made it work. Now, I love short boarding when the waves are over one meter. Fast, responsive,
                    and perfect for carving itâ€™s my go-to for solid days.</p>
            </div>
    
            <button class="btn btn-white" data-style="mid-length" style="min-width: 280px;">
                Mid Length
            </button>
            <div class="style-info" id="mid-length" hidden>
                <p>Mid lengths are the perfect balance between a short board and a longboard. I enjoy the flow, the
                    different angles, and especially surfing with a single fin. Itâ€™s a great way to blend styles and
                    experiment with classic lines and turns.</p>
            </div>
    
            <button class="btn btn-black" data-style="long-board" style="min-width: 280px;">
                Long Board
            </button>
            <div class="style-info" id="long-board" hidden>
                <p>My longboard is my dance floor. I love expressing myself through movement â€” walking the board, laying
                    down, riding sideways, even throwing in a headstand now and then. Itâ€™s not just about standing up; itâ€™s
                    about playing with the wave.</p>
            </div>
    
            <button class="btn btn-white" data-style="body-surfing" style="min-width: 280px;">
                Body Surfing
            </button>
            <div class="style-info" id="body-surfing" hidden>
                <p>Body surfing isnâ€™t technically board surfing, but itâ€™s one of the best ways to connect with the ocean. On
                    days with closeouts or when I forget my board, I still go out. No gear needed just your body, maybe a
                    handplane and some fins if you like. Pure freedom in the waves.</p>
